                What is Coronavirus? Is it a virus or is the government trying to hide something from us? Are they
                trying to distract us from something? Possibly distract us from the elections. Did you know that on the
                CDC website the Caronavirus deaths have dropped significantly? Why is everyone making such a big fuss
                over this still? In the beginning when the deaths were higher they were only allowing certain people to
                get tested. Now EVERYONE is getting tested, so of course the number of positives are higher but that
                doesn't mean it's deadly. The results of the test are not even reliable. So many people have just signed 
                into getting the test and left and they have recieved positive results. How is that possible?! Let us 
                just say that it is not possible.

                Is a piece of cloth over your mouth going to prevent you from contracting a "deadly disease"? Multiple
                doctors and scientists have said that the mask will not prevent your from getting Coronavirus. The 
                particles of it are too small and they go straight through the mask. They also can go in on the sides
                if it is not a N95 mask that has been fitted to your face. It is so weird going into Walmart and seeing 
                EVERYONE with masks. I hate it when people start talking about this being the "new normal". Do masks 
                really there to protect us? But why are we being forced to wear one even if we are not sick? Why are
                our freedoms being taken away? Right now we can't enter that store without a mask and in 6 months when
                they release the vaccine (that has not been properly tested) that will be another requirent.

                What is really in a vaccine? More specifically, a Coronavirus vaccine. First off, it has aborted baby DNA! That 
                seems a bit wrong. But I also speculate if it has a chip in it. I know in the New Testament it prophesies that 
                we will be chipped. President Trump also made it seem as if this vaccine is going to be manditory. Once again,
                our freedoms are being taken away. We should have medical freedom to decline it if we see fit. It was also said that 
                the military will be sent out to make sure everyone gets it. What happens if someone does not want it? Are we goint 
                to be forced? Are we goint to be allowed to go to work? Will we be allowed to fly without proof of the vaccine? I hope
                this is a conspiracy because this is so far away from being constitutional.

                Why is there a coin shortage? Shouldn't we have a hand sanatizer shortage or a shortage of 
                masks? Why coins? Are we slowly but surely moving towards a cashless society? What will that mean?
                It means that our freedom is being taken away. We have a coin shortage because the workers making 
                coins are not considered "essential workers" like Walmart workers or Amazon workers. But why?
                Are they not considered essential for a reason? Is this part of the Secret Combination? If we are 
                cashless they have complete control and can see everything we do with our money. They have control
                of us and our funds! That is not constitutional. We should have every right to have cash saved and 
                have it to use however we see fit.
