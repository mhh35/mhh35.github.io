                    <h2>Temple Facts</h2>
                    <p> Houston Texas Temple was the second temple built in Texas, following the Dallas Texas Temple
                        (1984). The historic flooding in Southeast Texas created by Hurricane Harvey breached the
                        Houston Texas Temple on August 26, 2017, resulting in significant damage. The baptistry flooded
                        to the top, and water reached waist deep in some areas of the basement. Several inches of water
                        on the main floor ruined carpet and furniture. The temple was temporarily closed for repairs.

                    <h2>Flood Restoration</h2>
                    <p> On October 25, 2017, the First Presidency announced a short-term closure of the Houston Texas Temple. The temple has not been in use since floodwaters from Hurricane Harvey breached the temple on August 26, damaging the basement, main floor, and temple annex. The temple is anticipated to be rededicated in the spring of 2018. The private service will not be accompanied by an open house or cultural celebration.</p>
